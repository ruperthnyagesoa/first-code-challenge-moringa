# First Code Challenge @ Moringa School

## Goals
-Assessing my learning progress (technical skills) so far <br>
-Complying with the Institution’s academic requirements 

## Project Description  
This is a code challenge that integrates `3` separate problems as outlined below. Kindly use the browser(console) to execute the codes. Each challenge is included in a separate `.js` file. 

### First Challenge: Student Grade Generator (Toy Problem)
I was required to write a program that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. Then the program should evaluate and output the correct grade ranging from "A" as the highest grade to "E", which is the lowest grade as per the following marks' range.  
A > 79, B – 60 to 79, C -59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E – less 40. 

### Second Challenge: Speed Detector (Toy Problem)
The challenge entailed writing a program that take as input the speed of a car (km/hr). If the speed is equal to or less than 70km/hr, the program should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/hr above the speed limit (70km/hr), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points. 
For instance, if the speed is 75km/hr, the program should print: “Points: 1”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the program should print: “License suspended”. 

### Third Challenge: Net Salary Calculator (Toy Problem)
In the third challenge, I was to develop a program whose major task is to calculate an individual’s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. Calculate the paye (i.e Tax2), NHIF Deductions, NSSF Deductions, gross salary, and net salary. 

##### Values to use in the `Third Challenge` are obtained from:
